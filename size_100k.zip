SCAFFOLDING




CHAPTER I

_SCAFFOLDING_


Scaffolding is the art of arranging and combining pieces of timber in
order to enable workmen to proceed with their work, and from which, if
required, to lift and carry the material necessary for their purpose.
Many definitions of a scaffold have been given by authorities on
building construction; some of the best known are as follows:—

Mitchell (C. F.): 'Temporary erections constructed to support a number
of platforms at different heights, raised for the convenience of
workmen to enable them to get at their work and to raise the necessary
material for the same.’

Tredgold (Hurst): 'A scaffold as used in building is a temporary
structure supporting a platform by means of which the workmen and their
materials are brought within reach of their work.’

Rivington: 'Scaffolds are temporary erections of timber supporting
platforms close to the work, on which the workmen stand and deposit
their materials.’

Banister F. Fletcher, in 'Carpentry and Joinery’: 'A scaffold is a
temporary structure placed alongside a building to facilitate its
erection by supporting workmen and raising materials during the
construction, or for the repair of buildings.’

Recent cases tried under the Workmen’s Compensation Act have given a
wider meaning to the word, and the following definition is perhaps the
most comprehensive at the present time:

A scaffold, as used in building, is a temporary arrangement of timbers
combined and supported in various ways to enable the workmen to proceed
with their work, and where required, to afford facilities for the
lifting and carrying of the materials.

The two principal methods of scaffolding are known respectively as the
North and South country systems. The northern, as indicated by the
name, was at one time in use only in Scotland and the north of England,
but its many advantages, more especially for the transport of material,
have now caused it to become general throughout the country.

The second method is essentially the South country system, and is of
greater use when power is not necessary for the construction of the
building.

A combination of both methods is commonly seen, and found useful in
practice.

In scaffolding, the vertical timbers are known as standards or
uprights. The horizontal timbers between the standards are known as
ledgers when of cylindrical section, but as transoms and runners when
of rectangular section. Braces, shores, struts and ties of any section
are pieces used to stiffen the structure. The putlogs, or joists as
they are called when of greater length, carry the boards which form the
working platform.


=The Northern System.=—This scaffolding can be divided into two
parts. First, the derrick staging from which the transporting power
acts; and, second, the platforms, which bring the workmen within reach
of their work.


=Derrick Stagings.=—These stagings, also known as Scotch derricks
and 'Scotchmen,’ are erected to carry the power required, usually a
steam crane.

They consist of three or four timber towers or legs supporting a
platform upon which the crane stands. The number of legs depends upon
the area over which the power is required to act.

When one crane is to be erected, three legs are sufficient to carry the
platform.

If the building is a large one, several such stagings may be
constructed; but in some cases two cranes are required where the size
of the building will not allow of two stagings. In these cases the
platform is square and supported at each angle by a leg. The cranes are
then fixed diametrically opposite each other.

In determining the position of the legs they must be placed where the
effective range of the crane is most required, and also where they will
cause the least possible obstruction to the progress of the building.
The position of the tower that carries the crane, and which is known
as the principal or king leg, is first fixed. The secondary or queen
legs are set out from it in the form of an isosceles triangle. The
distance between the king and queen legs depends upon the length of
the sleepers. These run from below the engine to the lower ends of the
guys, and average from 25 to 30 feet in length.

The legs, especially the king legs, if intended to rise from the earth,
must have a foundation of two thicknesses of 3-inch timbering laid
crosswise. This is unnecessary if there is a concrete or other solid
foundation.

Apart from the necessity for any foundation, the standards should rise
from a framework of balk timbers of about 12 in. by 12 in., laid on the
ground, and halved at their intersection (fig. 1).

[Illustration: FIG. 1.—ELEVATION OF STAGING FOR DERRICK CRANE]

In the case of the queen legs an extra balk is placed under the
framework, as shown in fig. 1.

The legs are from 6 to 10 feet square on plan, the king legs being the
larger. Each leg comprises four standards, either of whole timbers or
battens bolted together. The standards for the king legs should measure
not less than 9 in. by 9 in.; if of battens, then three pieces 9 in. by
3 in. should be used.

For the queen legs, balks 7 in. by 7 in., or three pieces 7 in. by
2-1/2 in., are sufficient sectional area. Where battens are used they
are given a lap equal to one-third of their full length, and are bolted
together by 3/4-inch wrought-iron bolts.

Whole timbers are used when they can be obtained in one piece of
sufficient length.

As the standards rise they are divided into bays by transoms. These are
made out of about 9-in. by 3-in. deals, placed from about 6 to 10 feet
apart.

The bays are triangulated by cross-braces 7 in. by 2-1/2 in.; both of
these are usually placed on the outside of the bay, but one or both
may be placed on the inside. The first method is the better, as the
braces, by butting against the transoms, give an increased resistance
to movement.

The king leg, having to carry the weight of the engine, requires
greater strength. This is gained by running an extra standard up the
centre of the leg. If it is whole timber, balks about 14 in. by 14 in.
are required; if built up, four deals 16 in. by 4 in. are used. It
should stand upon an extra balk laid with the horizontal framing at the
bottom of the leg, and should rest on a solid foundation.

To prevent any tendency to flexure this extra standard should be
strutted from all four of the outer standards behind each transom (see
fig. 2).

Another method is to shore the central standard from the foundation, as
in fig. 3.

The legs in this manner can be made to support a platform up to 120
feet in height.

The required height having been reached, the legs are connected by
trussed beams in the following manner: Two balk timbers of about 12 in.
by 8 in. are laid immediately above each other between the king leg
and each queen leg, resting on the two top transoms, as shown in fig.
1. They are from 6 to 9 feet apart, the top bay being sometimes made
slightly lower than the others.

The lower balks are connected to the centre standard of the king leg by
wrought-iron straps.

[Illustration: FIG. 2.—PLAN OF KING LEG]

[Illustration: A, Central Standard. B, Shorings.

FIG. 3.—SHOWING SHORING TO CENTRAL STANDARD]

The top balks project from 6 to 10 feet beyond the king leg, and
are halved at their point of intersection. The projecting ends are
connected to each other by pieces 8 in. by 6 in., and again to the
return balk by similar pieces (see fig. 4). They are also supported by
struts from the central standard, as shown in fig. 1. The upper and
lower balks are connected by iron bolts about 10 feet apart, and each
bay thus formed is cross-braced in the same manner as the legs.

The iron bolts are covered by pieces of the same scantling as the
braces.

In the single derricks the queen legs can be connected by a trussed
beam similarly formed, or by a single balk carried across and laid on
the top transom.

[Illustration: FIG. 4.—PLAN OF TOP PLATFORM PARTIALLY COVERED]

If the span is considerable, struts can be carried from the queen legs
towards the centre of the underside of the balk to prevent sagging.

On the trussed beams thus formed, joists of 9 in. by 3 in. or ordinary
poles are laid about 3 feet apart.

They are laid parallel to one another, and in a direction at right
angles to the truss or single beam forming the back support of the
platform.

The centre joists are continued to the ends of the balks which project
beyond the king leg.

The advantage of having continued the top balks can now be seen, as it
gives greater area to the platform immediately round the engine.

The boards 9 in. by 1-1/2 in. are laid at right angles to the joists.

Another way of forming the platform is to cover only partially the
surface between the legs. In this case two additional joists, 6 in.
by 6 in., are thrown across the king leg (see fig. 4), the boards not
extending beyond their length.

When this is done, the workmen reach the platform from the
communicating ladder which usually passes up a queen leg, by means of a
run two boards wide. It is better to lay the larger platform, as, apart
from the question of safety to the men, it serves as a storage for coal
for the engine, the weight of which tends to keep the erection steady.
Double boards should be laid under coals or other heavy stores.

To reach the platform, ladders are fixed in different ways. They can
run up inside, or be fixed to the outside of the queen legs. In either
case they are nearly or entirely upright. A better method is shown in
fig. 5, and should be carried out wherever possible.

[Illustration: FIG. 5.—SHOWING METHOD OF FIXING LADDERS]

The derrick sleepers, two in number, are of balk timber, and lie across
the platform from beneath the engine bed to which they are connected,
to the centre of the queen legs.

The guys or stays, also of balk timbers, besides being connected to the
mast, are attached to the sleepers over the queen legs (see fig. 1).

To counteract the overturning force exerted by the jib and the material
lifted, the guys are chained down to the timber balk at the bottom of
the queen legs (fig. 1).

This balk supports a platform which is loaded with bricks or stones
more than equal to double the weight that will be lifted. The chain,
which works loose with the vibration of the scaffold, is tightened by
means of a screw coupler fixed in its length. The arrangement is as
follows:—Two lengths of heavy chain with large links at each end are
required. One length is carried round the sleeper and then taken down
the centre of the leg. The other length is taken round the balk which
is placed underneath the staging, and carried up through the load, when
the tightening screw can be applied and the correct tension brought up.

To prevent lateral motion the legs are cross-braced by poles or deals
between each leg as shown on frontispiece. The poles are tied to the
legs just beneath the platform and connected at their meeting point.
When crossing they should be at right angles to each other.

Deals 9 in. by 3 in. can take the place of the poles if required, bolts
in this case being used instead of tyings.

At the building of the new Post Office, Leeds, 1893, a different method
of raising the platform for the crane was adopted. The legs, instead
of being framed, consisted of a single balk of timber strutted on
each side from the ground level, the sleepers and guys being firmly
attached to the standards themselves.

When erecting long ranges of buildings it may be more convenient to
have the derrick mounted upon a travelling bogie than to dismantle the
structure in order to re-erect at another point.

Fig. 6 illustrates the system, the travelling power being usually
manual. The arrangement is suitable for small derricks, and is employed
where the crane is erected outside the building.

[Illustration: FIG. 6.—SHOWING STAGING MOUNTED ON TRAVELLING
BOGIE]

Another method of using travelling cranes is to erect a platform as
shown in fig. 7.

The standards, which may be of balk timber or built up, as previously
shown, are about 10 feet apart longitudinally and 20 to 30 feet
transversely. They stand upon sills of the same section where the
foundation is not solid. On the head of the standards, the runners are
laid connecting all the standards in the same row.

Head pieces may be fitted between the standards and runners; this
serves to distribute pressure. All the connections are securely made by
dog irons, bolts, and straps. The stability depends entirely upon the
bracing, and this, it is important to note, should be between each bay
longitudinally, and at least every second bay transversely.

[Illustration: Front Elevation

End Elevation

FIG. 7.—ELEVATION OF DERRICK STAGING]

Timbers placed as A in fig. 7 give rigidity to the standards by
preventing flexure, and are necessary when the lengths of the uprights
exceed 30 times their least diameter.

The deals used for braces are bolted to the standards; for poles, tying
is resorted to.


=Working Platforms.=—The working platforms used in conjunction
with overhead or overhand work depend upon the requirements of the
building.

By over head or hand work is meant that the material upon which the
mechanic is to be employed reaches him from over head or hand.

When no outside scaffolding is needed, the platforms are laid upon
the floor joints in the interior of the building, being raised upon
trestles as the work proceeds, and until the next floor is reached.

Light forms of scaffolds, as the ordinary masons’ and bricklayers’ pole
scaffolds, are now frequently used as working platforms in connection
with the Scotch system.


=The South Country System.=—This system is divided into two
classes according to the strength required. For the first, square
timbers are used; for the second, poles are employed. The scaffolds
built of square timbers are known as gantries and stagings, and the
pole erections are termed bricklayers’, and masons’ or independent
scaffolds.


=Gantries.=—The term gantry was originally given to erections
constructed with a view to the easy carriage of heavy material, but of
late it has also come to mean a structure arranged to support lighter
forms of scaffolding over footpaths which have to be kept open for
public use.

[Illustration: FIG. 8.—ELEVATION OF GANTRY FOR TRAVELLER]

[Illustration: FIG. 8A.—END ELEVATION OF GANTRY SHOWN IN FIG.
8]

1st. Gantries for transport of material, commonly called travellers.
Figs. 8 and 8a show the general construction.

The distance between the outer rows of standards and the wall depends
upon circumstances. If possible, the space should be allowed for a
cart-way, as the material can thus be brought quite close to the work
before being lifted. If, owing to adjacent footpaths or any other
reason, this cannot be done, the uprights should be placed close to the
wall on either side, the material being lifted at the end of the gantry
or other convenient spot, over which the lifting gear can be brought.

The standards of square timber for the gantry are from 6 in. to 12
in. square, and are erected upon sleepers, or, as they are sometimes
termed, sills laid in the same direction as the run of the scaffold.
One row of standards is placed on each side of the wall. The standards
are placed 8 to 10 feet apart. On the top of the standards runners are
fixed connecting each standard in the same row. Sills, standards, and
runners should be of the same sectional area. The runners are strutted
on their underside, from the standards by pieces of, at least, half the
sectional area of the supported timbers. If the struts are of equal
size to the runners, double the weight can be carried.

The cleats from which the struts rise, are simply spiked to the
standards, but if designed to carry excessive weights they are slightly
housed in. As the space between each row of standards has to be kept
open for the building, no cross bracing can be allowed except at the
ends. Strutting is therefore resorted to in order to give stability.
The struts, one to each standard, are bolted to the upright near the
top, and again to a foot block driven into the ground. Other methods of
fastening down the bottom ends of the struts are shown in fig. 9; the
use of each depends upon the nature of the soil.

Struts are also fixed at the ends to prevent lateral movement. Head
pieces, or corbels, as they are sometimes termed, are occasionally
inserted between the standards and runners, and serve to distribute
pressure.

Straining pieces spiked on the underside of the runners, for the struts
to pitch against, are used when the standards are considerably apart.

[Illustration: FIG. 9.—FOOTING BLOCKS FOR STRUTS]

Rails upon which the travelling engine or traveller can move are laid
on top of the runners, and are turned up at the ends of the platform to
serve as buffers to the engine platform.

[Illustration: End Elevation

Side Elevation

FIG. 10.—ELEVATION OF TRAVELLING GANTRY]

The engine platform consists of two trussed beams of timber about 3
feet apart, connected at their ends with short pieces of the same
scantling, and fitted with grooved wheels to move upon the rails.
Rails are also laid upon each beam and serve for the traversing motion
of the crab. Movement of the traveller is obtained from the crab,
which is worked either by manual or steam power, and acts through a
system of shafting and geared wheels. Movement in three directions is
necessary from the crab: vertically for lifting, and horizontally in
two directions, transversely and longitudinally. Travellers are made up
to 50 feet wide and any required length.

Another method of building travellers is shown in fig. 10.

In this case, the rails upon which the traveller moves in a
longitudinal direction are fixed on sleepers on the ground level,
and the standards and runners of the first example are not required.
In their place is constructed a triangulated system of balk timber
framing. The platform is fixed to the head pieces, and is braced as
shown. Less timber is used in their construction, but owing to the
greater weight a steam winch is required to impart motion.


=Gantries which serve as a base for lighter forms of
scaffolding.=—These erections are in reality elevated platforms,
and allow of a clear way for a footpath where required. They are
constructed of two frames, placed apart according to the width of the
path over which the platform stands (fig. 11).

The method of erection, so far as the side frames are concerned, is
the same as for the first example of travelling gantries. Stability
is, however, gained by cross-bracing as shown in figure, thus making
strutting unnecessary. The platform can be laid by placing short boards
9 in. by 3 in. across the runners when the platform is narrow. It is
more usual, however, to place joists 10 in. by 2 in. across, and on
these to lay the boards longitudinally. The joists average 2 to 3
feet apart, the braces are about 2 in. by 7 in. On the outside of the
scaffold, parallel to the sills, balk timbers are placed forming a
'fender’ to prevent the vehicular traffic from injuring or disturbing
the erection.

FIG 11.—GANTRY OR ELEVATED PLATFORM OVER FOOTPATHS]


=Stagings.=—Stagings are erected in a manner similar to travelling
gantries, but are carried more than one storey high (fig. 12). It is a
form of scaffolding rarely seen, more especially since the introduction
of the Scotch derrick system. The timbers are erected to the height of
the first runner in the same manner as the frames in fig. 11. In order
to carry the scaffold higher, horizontal pieces are laid across the
scaffold, over the standards, and are made to project 9 or 10 feet on
each side of the runners.

On these beams, uprights, as in the first tier, are raised, being
connected in like manner, longitudinally by transoms. The rising tiers
of standards are strutted by timbers A A, rising from the
projecting portion of the beam called the footing piece, which serves
in the same manner as a footing block. The footing piece is supported by
struts, B B, rising from the lower standards. The struts B
B are in two pieces, being bolted to the sides of the footing
pieces and uprights. This allows the shores A A to pass
between them.

[Illustration: Front Elevation

Cross Section

FIG. 12.—EXAMPLE OF STAGINGS]

Strutting within the bays formed by the standards is carried out on
each tier with the exception of the top, where braces are fixed, as
shown at C.

On the top runners rails are laid for a traveller.

In constructing the foregoing square timber erection, note should be
taken of the following points:—

That the uprights of the upper tiers should stand immediately over
those of the lower tiers, in order to prevent cross strains on the
runners.

That the timbers should fit as evenly as possible, as thereby the whole
erection is rendered more stable.

That joints between the runners should occur immediately over the
standards.

The several parts of this structure, if for temporary purposes, can
be connected by dog irons; if for a more permanent use, by bolts and
straps.


POLE SCAFFOLDS


=Bricklayers’ Scaffolds.=—A bricklayer’s scaffold consists of a
series of upright poles or standards, to which are lashed horizontal
poles, termed ledgers. The ledgers and the wall of the building carry
the putlogs, on which boards are laid to support the workman, his
material, and tools (fig. 13).

The standards are first erected, and may stand singly or in pairs. In
a repairing job, unless of great height, and where there is no great
weight of material, single poles are sufficient.

Where double poles are required, the first pair are erected of
different lengths.

The short pole is termed a puncheon. The difference of length allows of
a lap in connecting the succeeding poles.

The lap should equal half of the full-length pole. The standards are
placed 6 to 8 feet apart, and from 4 to 6 feet away from the building.

[Illustration: FIG. 13.—ELEVATION OF POLE SCAFFOLD]

The butt-ends are embedded about 2 feet in the ground, which affords
some resistance to overturning. If they cannot be embedded, they
should be placed on end in barrels filled with earth tightly rammed.
As the building rises additional poles are added, being lashed to the
standards already erected.

If the standard is a single pole, the second pole, having a lap of 10
or 15 feet, stands upon a putlog placed close to the first pole for
that purpose (fig. 14).

The inner end of the putlog is securely fastened down to the scaffold
or inserted into the building.

If the standard is double, the rising pole is placed upon the top end
of the puncheon, and afterwards others are placed on end upon the
lowest free end of the standards already fixed.

[Illustration: FIG. 14.—METHOD OF FIXING RISING STANDARD]

As the standards rise, they are spliced or 'married’ together with band
ties.

At a height of 5 feet, this distance being the greatest at which a man
can work with ease, a ledger is tied across the standards to form a
support for the working platform.

Where a single pole is insufficient in length to form a continuous
ledger, two are joined in one of three ways.

[Illustration: FIG. 15]

In the first they are lapped over each other as fig. 15. This method
gives a strong connection, but prevents the putlogs being laid evenly.

[Illustration: FIG. 16]

The second way provides that the ledgers shall lap horizontally side by
side. This allows of evenness of line for the putlogs, but is not so
strong (fig. 16).

In both of these methods the lap should cover two standards, and not as
shown in fig. 17.

The third manner of connection (fig. 18) is the best. The ledgers butt
end to end. Underneath, a short pole is placed crossing two standards.
The tying at the standard embraces the double ledger. A band tie is run
round the supporting pole and the ends of the ledgers where they butt.

Great strength is obtained in this way and the putlogs can be evenly
laid.

Additional ledgers are fixed as the work proceeds.

[Illustration: FIG. 17]

On the ledgers, and at right angles to them, putlogs are laid, resting
outwardly on the ledgers and inwardly on the wall, where header bricks
have been left out for their reception.

[Illustration: FIG. 18]

The putlogs, which are placed about 3 or 4 feet apart, should be tied
to the ledgers and fastened by wedges into the wall. This is not often
done, but at least one putlog to every tying between standard and
ledger should be so treated.

Where the putlogs cannot be carried by the wall owing to an aperture in
the building, such as a window, they are supported by bearers fixed as
shown in figs. 19 and 20.

[Illustration: FIG. 19]

[Illustration: FIG. 20]

By wedging the inner end of the putlog into the wall, some stability
is given to the scaffold, but the connection cannot be considered
satisfactory, as the putlog would draw under very little strain.
Greater stability can be gained if the outer frame of the scaffold is
supported by one of the three methods given as follows.

[Illustration: FIG. 21.—SHORES AND TIES FOR DEPENDENT
SCAFFOLDS]

A shore or tie can be fixed between the erection and the ground as
shown in fig. 21, or, if there are openings in the wall, supports can
be fixed as ties shown in the same diagram.

The ties or struts should be placed to every third or fourth standard
at about 25 feet from the ground, and their fastenings made good.
Additional ties should be carried within the building at a greater
height where possible. The stability of the scaffold under loads and
cross wind pressure, depends greatly upon the ties or shores, and their
fastenings should be well made and kept in good order. The historical
instance of the mechanic who, to escape a shower of rain, stood upon
the inner board of the platform, and by leaning against the building
pushed the scaffold over, should have no opportunity of recurrence.

[Illustration: FIG. 22]

To stiffen the scaffold longitudinally braces are tied on the outside
of the scaffold in the form of a St. Andrew’s cross (see fig. 13).

They start from the lower end of one standard and rise obliquely across
the scaffold to near the top, or some distance up a standard in the
same run. Tied at their crossing-point, connections are made to all the
main timbers of the scaffold with which they come in contact. Braces
are fixed in all exposed situations, and generally where the scaffold
is more than one pole (30 feet) in height.

[Illustration: FIG. 23]

The only exception to effective bracing being carried out is where the
building, being of irregular form, creates many breaks and returns in
the scaffolding. It is obvious that where a scaffold butts against or
breaks with a return wall, the tendency to lateral motion is lessened.

The boards, which are placed longitudinally across the putlogs, can be
laid to lap or butt at their ends. When lapping, one putlog only is
required to carry the ends of two series of boards (fig. 22).

When butting, two putlogs are required placed about 4 inches apart
(fig. 23).

The second method is the better, as the boards are not so likely to
lose their place or to trip the workmen. If heavy work is in progress
the boards are laid double. As the building rises, the boards are
carried up to each successive platform, but each tied putlog is left in
its place.

[Illustration: FIG. 24.—MASONS’ SCAFFOLDS: END ELEVATION]


=Masons’ Scaffolds.=—Masons’, or independent scaffolds differ from
the bricklayers’ in that they have to be self-contained. Owing to the
different material of which the building is erected, the putlogs cannot
rest upon the wall. If openings were left for them, as in brickwork,
the wall would be permanently disfigured, more especially when ashlar
fronted.

In order to gain the necessary support two parallel frames of standards
and ledgers are erected along the line of wall to be built (fig. 24).

They are from 4 to 5 feet apart, the inner frame being as close to
the wall as possible. As a heavier material has to be dealt with, the
standards are placed closer together, say from 4 to 5 feet.

[Illustration: FIG. 25.—LANDING STAGES]

The ledgers and braces are placed as before, the putlogs now resting on
ledgers at each end, and not on the wall at the innermost end, as in
the bricklayer’s scaffold.

To prevent cross movement of the scaffold, an additional method of
bracing is available in this system. An inner and outer standard are
connected by short braces across each bay, as shown in fig. 24.

This method of cross-bracing can be continued to the top of the
scaffold, and the braces should be put in longitudinally, about 20 feet
apart.

The platforms laid on all pole-scaffolds are from 4 to 5 feet wide. It
is usually necessary, on anything but the smallest jobs, to keep this
width free for the workman and his material.

In order, therefore, to provide a platform on which the material can be
landed, it is convenient to erect, on the outside of the scaffold, an
additional platform from 5 to 10 feet square (fig. 25).

It is constructed of standards, ledgers, and braces, in like manner as
the scaffold to which it is attached.

The face-boards, as shown in this figure, should be fixed wherever
material is being hoisted, to prevent any projection of the load
catching under a ledger and upsetting.


=Connections.=—The members of pole scaffolds are connected by
cordage. The names of the various knots are given in Chapter V.

The arranging of the various timbers used in erecting scaffolds is a
dangerous occupation, and one requiring skill and considerable nerve on
the part of the workmen. In the majority of cases, the timbers on the
ground level are placed in position by manual labour only, shear legs
being used to facilitate matters. When the scaffold rises, advantage is
taken of any rigid member on which pulley wheels can be hung, and by
this means the succeeding poles, &c. are raised, manual dexterity and
strength being responsible for their final position.




CHAPTER II

_SCAFFOLDS FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES_


When applying the given methods for scaffolding, difficulties arise
owing to the varying designs of the buildings under construction or
repair.

It is impossible to deal with these cases in detail; they must be left
to the scaffolder, who, while holding closely to the principles, by
the exercise of ingenuity will make combinations and variations of the
various systems to suit the special requirements demanded in each case.
There are, however, certain types of scaffolding which occur with some
regularity, and these will now be dealt with.


=Needle Scaffolding.=—Needle scaffolding is necessary where it is
impossible or too expensive to carry the scaffold from the ground level
or other solid base. It is used both for repairing and new erections.

The needles from which the scaffold takes its name are timbers (usually
poles or balks) placed horizontally through and at right angles, or
nearly so, to the wall of the building. The projections support a
platform upon which an ordinary pole scaffold is erected (fig. 26).

Windows, or other openings in the wall, are utilised where possible for
the poles to pass through. In other cases holes have to be made in the
walls, cut as nearly as can be to the size of the needles in use.

The needles must be of sufficient scantling to carry the weight of the
scaffold and attendant loads. The stability of the structure depends
upon the means taken to fasten down the inner end of the needle.

The usual plan is to tie it down to a convenient joist or other rigid
member of the building itself, but the method shown on the diagram is
better, as resistance to movement is gained both from above and below.

Struts from the building below the needles to their outer end, give
greater strength to the beam.

When erecting needle scaffolding around buildings of small area, say of
a tower or chimney shaft, the needles can be laid across the building
in one length, piercing the wall on opposite sides. In these cases, if
the needles are wedged in, the weight of the building and the scaffold
itself on the opposite ends of the needles, is sufficient to maintain
equilibrium.

[Illustration: FIG. 26.—NEEDLE SCAFFOLD]

The platform is formed of 9-in. by 3-in. deals, and on this is erected
whatever scaffolding may be necessary.


=Scaffolds for Chimney Shafts, Towers, and Steeples.=—The erection
of chimney shafts can be carried on entirely by the aid of internal
scaffolding. As the work rises putlogs are laid across the shaft, the
ends being well built into the wall. On the putlogs the platform is
laid, being carried up as the work proceeds. The putlogs may be left in
for the time, and struck on completion. The platform is fitted in its
centre with a hinged flap door through which the material is hoisted as
required.

There is some objection to this method of scaffolding where the wall
is more than 1 foot 10-1/2 inches thick (which is the greatest depth
of brickwork over which a man can reach and do finished work), for
the mechanics, in order to reach the outside joints, have to kneel on
the freshly laid material, which is detrimental to good workmanship.
For this reason the system of carrying up an ordinary pole scaffold
externally until the height is reached where the wall is reduced to 1
foot 10-1/2 inches in thickness, is to be preferred.

The walls of a chimney shaft decrease in thickness 4-1/2 inches at a
time, forming an internal set-back of that width at every 20 feet in
height.

This set-back is of advantage to internal scaffolding when the full
height of the brickwork is reached, and the cap has to be fixed. The
cap or coping, when of stone or iron, does not admit of the insertion
of putlogs. To overcome the difficulty, four or more standards are
erected at equal distances, and standing upon the top set-back (fig.
27).

The standards project sufficiently to carry the pulley wheel well above
the total height of the chimney, in order to give head room and to
assist the workman in fixing the coping.

To stiffen the standards, short ledgers are tied across as shown in
fig. 27.

[Illustration: PLATE II.

  [_Photo by W. Cottrell_      _Hightown, Manchester._]

EXTERNAL CHIMNEY SCAFFOLD.

Erected for the Willesden Electric Lighting Works, under the
supervision of E. Willis, Esq., A.M.I.C.E., etc.]

When the chimney is to be erected by external scaffolding the
ordinary mason’s or bricklayer’s scaffold is used. Owing to the small
area of the erection the outside frames of the scaffold have a quick
return. This makes it practically impossible for the scaffold to
fail by breaking away from the building under the influence of the
loads it may carry. Shoring or tying is therefore not so important.
Wind pressures have, however, a greater effect, especially when the
direction is not at right angles to one of the faces of the scaffold.
If in that direction, the tied putlogs would offer resistance. Braces
are therefore imperative, and they should be fixed at right angles
to each other, each pair thus bracing a portion of the height of the
scaffold equal to its width. (See plate 2.)

For the repair of chimney shafts without scaffolding from the ground
level, means have to be taken to bring, first the mechanic, and
afterwards his material, within reach of the work.

[Illustration: FIG. 27]

The preliminary process of kite-flying is now rarely seen, except for
square-topped chimneys, and even in these cases the delay that may
arise while waiting for a suitable steady wind is a drawback to its
practice. The kites used are about 10 feet long and 8 feet wide. They
are held at four points by cords which continue for a distance of about
16 feet, and then unite into one. Near this point on the single rope
another cord is attached, which serves to manipulate the kite into
position.

Stronger ropes or chains are then pulled over the shaft, after which a
workman ascends, and the necessary pulley wheels and timbers to form a
regular means of ascent are sent up after him.

A light line carried up in the interior of the shaft by a hot-air
balloon is another means of communication.

The most certain and safest method of ascent is to raise on the
exterior of the shaft a series of light ladders, which are lashed to
each other and firmly fixed to the chimney as they ascend.

The ladders have parallel sides, and are used up to 22 feet in length.

One method of fixing is as follows:—

A ladder is placed against the shaft on its soundest side. It rests
at its top end against a block of wood slightly longer than the width
of the ladder, and which keeps it from 7 to 9 inches away from the
wall. This space allows room for the workmen’s feet when climbing. The
ladder is then fixed by two hooks of round steel driven into the wall,
one on each side immediately under the blocks, the hooks turning in
and clipping the sides of the ladder (fig. 28). The hooks, which have
straight shanks of 7/8-inch diameter with wedge-shaped points, are
driven well home, as the stability of the erection depends upon their
holding firmly.

Above the top end of the ladder a steel hook is driven into the wall
on which a pulley block can be hung, or instead, a pin with a ring
in its head can be so fixed. A rope from the ground level is passed
through this block or ring, and reaches downward again for connection
to the ladder next required. The connection is made by lashing the
rope to the top rung and tying the end to the seventh or eighth rung
from the bottom; this causes the ladder to rise perpendicularly. The
steeplejack who is standing on the already fixed ladder cuts the top
lashing as the hoisted ladder reaches him, and guides it into its place
as it rises. When the rung to which the rope is tied reaches the pulley
block, the ladders should overlap about 5 feet. They are at once lashed
together at the sides, not round the rungs.

[Illustration: FIG. 28]

The workmen can now climb higher, driving in hooks round the sides,
and under the rungs of the ladder alternately, lashings being made at
each point. A wooden block is placed under the top end of the last
ladder and fixed as before. The hoisting rope, which has been kept taut
meanwhile, is now loosened and the process repeated.

The ladders rise in this manner until the coping of the shaft is
reached. Here, owing to the projection of the cap which throws the
ladders out of line, it is impossible to lash the top ladder to the
lower. To overcome the difficulty, the wall is drilled in two places
immediately over the topmost fixed ladder, and expansion bolts are
fitted therein. To these bolts the lower end of the top ladder is tied.
The hoisting rope is then tightened sufficiently to hold the ladder,
and by this means the workmen are enabled to reach the top of the shaft.

A variation of this method of climbing is to replace the wooden blocks
by iron dogs with 9-inch spikes, which should be driven well into the
wall. Short ladders of about 10 feet in length are then used, these
being lashed to the dogs as they rise.

Another method of fixing the ladders is shown in fig. 29.

[Illustration: FIG. 29]

In this case eye-bolts are driven horizontally into the wall in pairs,
rather wider apart than the width of the ladders.

Iron rods hook into these and are fastened to the ladder sides by thumb
screws.

The ladders rise above each other and are connected by 3-inch sockets.

When fixed, they stand about 18 inches from the wall. This is an
advantage, as it enables the workmen to climb on the inside of the
ladders, thus lessening the strain on the eye-bolts, and the ladder can
more easily pass a projecting chimney cap.

On the other hand, the whole weight of the ladders rests upon the
bottom length, so that if through any cause it gave way, for instance
under accidental concussion, the entire length would most certainly
collapse.

This danger could be avoided if the ladders were supported on brackets
as fig. 30. No reliance should be placed upon the thumb screws, as
they may work loose under vibration. Danger from this source would be
avoided if the slot in which the ladder peg moved was made as shown in
fig. 30.

[Illustration: FIG. 30]

The necessary repairs can be carried out by means of boats, cradles, or
scaffolding.

Cradles and boats are swung from balk timbers laid across the top of
the shaft, or from hooks where the design of the chimney permits, as
shown in fig. 31.

The common method of fixing light scaffolds round a chimney or steeple
is shown in fig. 32. They are most easily fixed to square or other
flat-sided erections. The scaffolder having by means of ladders or
boats reached the desired height, fixes a putlog by means of holdfasts
to one of the walls. Another putlog is then fixed on the opposite side
of the building at the same level. The two are next bolted together by
1-inch iron bolts of the required length. The bolts are kept as near to
the wall as possible. The process is repeated again about 6 feet higher
on the building. The boards for the platforms are next laid. The first
are placed at right angles to the putlogs and project sufficiently to
carry the boards which are laid parallel to the putlogs. To prevent the
boards rising when weight is applied at one side of the scaffold, iron
plates bolted together (fig. 33) are fixed at the corners, and clips
(fig. 34) connect them to the putlogs.

[Illustration: FIG. 31] [Illustration: FIG. 32]

[Illustration: FIG. 33]

The stability of these scaffolds depends upon fixing at least two sets
of putlogs, connected by means of stays as shown in fig. 32. Bracing
is unnecessary if the putlogs and bolts tightly grip the building.
When these scaffolds are used on circular chimneys, chucks have to be
fitted on the inside of the putlogs to prevent them being drawn by the
bolts to a curve. The chucks (fig. 35) can be fastened to the putlogs
before they are fixed, if the curve of the building is accurately
known. When this is not the case, the putlogs are fixed by a holdfast
at their centre. The chucks are then placed in position, and clamped to
the putlogs as shown in fig. 36.

Additional holdfasts are then driven into the wall immediately under
the chucks, so that the putlogs are kept level.

[Illustration: FIG. 34]

[Illustration: FIG. 35]

The putlogs are fixed on edge, and when not exceeding 16 feet in length
are 7 in. by 3 in. Above that length they are 9 in. by 3 in. The stays
should be 4 in. by 2 in., and connected to the putlogs by 5/8-inch
iron bolts. The platform is usually of three boards 11 in. by 2 in.

[Illustration: FIG. 36]

[Illustration: FIG. 37]

Hollow towers are erected or repaired in the same manner as chimney
shafts, except that climbing ladders are not often required. External
or internal scaffolds may be erected. Towers being usually of larger
area than chimney shafts, the putlogs for internal scaffolding are
often of short poles from 6 to 8 inches diameter. Even these may
require extra support. This is gained by carrying standards from the
ground level or other solid foundation and tying to the putlogs. If of
great height the standards may be unable to carry their own weight. For
the cases where danger might be apprehended from this cause, fig. 37
shows a system of framing, which, being supported by the set-back in
the thickness of the wall, will carry the upper standards.

Steeples are generally built by the aid of external scaffolds, which,
as in the case of chimney shafts, should be well braced. The lower
portion may also be repaired in this way, the standards rising from the
ground level, or, if so designed, from the top of the tower. A series
of needles could be arranged for the higher portions.

[Illustration: FIG. 38]


=Domes and arches.=—The scaffolding for domes and arches consists
of a series of standards standing upon the area covered by the
building, and connected by ledgers and braces in directions at right
angles to each other. The platform is laid on the top ledgers.

When the building is of large span square timbers are often used, balks
for standards and runners, and half timbers for struts and braces.

Fig. 38 shows a design for repairing roofs and arches where a roadway
has to be kept below.


=Swinging scaffolds. Painters’ boats or cradles.=—Painters’ boats
are useful scaffolds for the repair of buildings, more especially where
the work is light. Fig. 39 shows the general construction. They are
suspended from jibs, fixed usually on the roof for outside work, and by
means of blocks and falls they can be moved in a vertical direction by
the workmen when in the boat.

[Illustration: FIG. 39]

The boats are fitted with guard boards and rails, and their safety,
providing the jibs are well fixed by balancing weights, is in their
favour. They are not self-supporting, and there is a distinct danger of
their running down if the sustaining ropes are not securely fastened
off. The wind causes them to sway considerably, and their use is
confined chiefly to façade work. An improved cradle is now in general
use, which is slung by head blocks from a wire cable running between
two jibs (see fig. 40). By the aid of guy lines movement in this case
can be also obtained horizontally, which removes the necessity of
shifting the jibs or employing a greater number of boats as in the
older method.

[Illustration: FIG. 40]

[Illustration: FIG. 41]

Another cradle as shown in fig. 41 has advantages which cannot be
ignored. It has steel cables with a breaking weight of 15 cwt. instead
of fibre ropes, and the cradle is raised and lowered by means of
gearing and a drum fixed in the gear case A. It is self-supporting,
and therefore safer than the cradle mentioned above. The lower ends of
the cable are fastened to the drum, and the gearing gives sufficient
mechanical advantage for one man to raise the scaffold by turning the
handle B. The uprights and rails are of angle steel or barrel and will
take apart and fold.

[Illustration: FIG. 42]

The boatswain’s boat (see fig. 42) is useful under some circumstances,
especially for making examinations of buildings for possible damage.
It is dangerous and awkward to work from, and is also acted upon
considerably by the wind.

The boat is slung from a single needle. The workman has no control over
its movement, as he has to be raised or lowered as required by men
having charge of the other end of the fall.

[Illustration: FIG. 43]

[Illustration: FIG. 44]

[Illustration: FIG. 45]

[Illustration: FIG. 46]

=Ladder scaffolds.=—A light scaffold of ladders braced, and
connected by rails, which also serve the purpose of guard rails, is
shown in fig. 43. The ladders, which have parallel sides, are placed
about 2 feet away from the building. The boards forming the platform
can be laid on the ladder rungs, or if necessary on brackets as shown
in fig. 44. The ladders are prevented from falling away from the
building by ties which are connected to the ladder as shown in fig. 45,
and fastened to the window openings by extension rods as shown in fig.
46. The same figure illustrates the method of tying in the scaffold
when the ladders are not opposite to the windows, the rail A
being connected to at least two ladders. The braces and guard rails are
bored for thumb screws at one end, the other being slotted so that they
can be adjusted as required. This form of scaffold is only suitable for
repairing purposes, and no weight of material can be stored upon it.

A light repairing scaffold lately put on the market has a platform
which is supported and not suspended, but otherwise affords about the
same scope to the workmen as the painters’ boats. It consists of one
pole and a platform, the latter being levered up and down the pole as
required by a man standing on the platform itself. The whole apparatus
can be moved by one man standing at the bottom. It is an arrangement
comparatively new to the English trade, but is in considerable use in
Denmark, Germany, and Sweden.




CHAPTER III

_SHORING AND UNDERPINNING_


Shoring is the term given to a method of temporarily supporting
buildings by a framing of timber acting against the walls of the
structure. If the frame consists of more than one shore, it is called a
system; if of two or more systems, it becomes a series.

The forces that tend to render a building unstable are due primarily
to gravity, but owing to the various resistances set up by the tying
together of the building, the force does not always exert itself
vertically downwards.

This instability may arise from various causes, the most common being
the unequal settlement of materials in new buildings, the pulling
down of adjoining buildings, structural alterations and defects, and
alterations or disturbances of the adjacent ground which affect the
foundations. The pulling down of an adjoining building would, by
removing the corresponding resistance, allow the weight of the internal
structure of the building to set up forces which at first would act
in a horizontal direction outwards. Structural defects, such as an
insufficiently tied roof truss, would have the same effect. Structural
alterations, such as the removal of the lower portion of a wall in
order to insert a shop front would allow a force due to gravity to act
vertically downwards.

To resist these forces, three different methods of shoring are in
general use, and they are known as flying or horizontal shores, raking
shores, and underpinning.


_Flying Shores._—Where the thrusts acting upon the wall are in
a horizontal direction, flying or raking shores are used to give
temporary support. The most direct resistance is gained by the
first-named, the flying or horizontal shore. There are, however, limits
to its application, as, owing to the difficulty of obtaining sound
timber of more than 50 to 60 feet in length, a solid body is necessary
within that distance, from which the required purchase can be obtained.

It is a method of shoring generally used where one house in a row is to
be taken down, the timbers being erected as demolition proceeds, and
taken down again as the new work takes its place.

Fig. 47 shows a half-elevation of two general systems of construction.

The framing, as at A, may be used alone where the wall to be
supported is of moderate height and the opening narrow, but larger
frames should be combined, as at B.

The framework C is for wide openings and walls of considerable
height.

The wall plates, 9 in. by 2 in. or 9 in. by 3 in., are first fixed
vertically on the walls by wall hooks. Then, in a line with the floors,
rectangular holes 4 in. by 3 in. are cut in the centre of wall plates.
Into these holes, and at least 4-1/2 inches into the brickwork, needles
(also known as tossles and joggles) of the same size are fitted,
leaving a projection out from the wall plate of 5 in. or 6 in.,
sufficient to carry the shore of about 7 in. by 7 in.

The shore, prior to being fixed, has nailed on its top and under sides
straining pieces 2 inches thick, and of the same width as the shore. To
tighten, oak folding wedges are driven at one end between the shore and
wall plate.

[Illustration: FIG. 47]

To stiffen the shore, and to further equalise the given resistance
over the defective wall, raking struts are fixed between the straining
pieces, and cleats are nailed above and below the shore. These raking
struts are tightened by driving wedges between their ends and the
straining pieces.

The cleats previous to, and in addition to being nailed, should be
slightly mortised into the wall plate. This lessens the likelihood of
the nails drawing under the pressure.


=A Raking Shore= consists of a triangulated system of timber
framing, and is used to support defective walls where the resistance to
the threatened rupture has to be derived from the ground surrounding
the building.

In its simplest form a raking shore is a balk of timber of varying
scantlings, but as a rule of square section, inclined from the ground
to the defective wall. The angle of inclination is taken from the
horizon, and should vary between 60 and 75 degrees. In settling this
the space available at the foot of the wall has to be taken into
consideration, especially in urban districts where the wall abuts on
the footpath.

[Illustration: FIG. 48]

Fig. 48 shows a raking shore in its simplest form, but usually two or
more shores are used (see fig. 49).

The following table from Mr. Stock’s book[1] shows the general rule and
also the scantlings to be used:

  For walls from 15 to 30 feet high 2 shores are necessary in each system

  For walls from 30 to 40 feet high 3 shores are necessary in each system

  For walls from 40 feet high and upwards 4 shores are necessary in each
  system


[Illustration: FIG. 49.—EXAMPLE OF RAKING SHORE]

Taking the angle of the shore at from 60 to 75 degrees:

  For walls from 15 to 20 feet high 5 in. by 5 in. may be the scantling
                                                     for each shore

  For walls from 20 to 30 feet high 6 in. by 6 in. may be the scantling
                                                     for each shore
  For walls from 30 to 35 feet high 7 in. by 7 in. may be the scantling
                                                     for each shore
  For walls from 35 to 40 feet high 8 in. by 8 in. may be the scantling
                                                     for each shore
  For walls from 40 to 50 feet high 9 in. by 9 in. may be the scantling
                                                     for each shore
  For walls from 50 feet and upwards 12 in. by 9 in. may be the scantling
                                                       for each shore

In the greatest length, the beams are 12 in. by 9 in. to give increased
rigidity, which prevents any likelihood of sagging.

The wall plate is the first timber put into position. It is placed
vertically down the face of the wall, and held in its position by wall
hooks. Note should then be taken of the position of floors. If the
floor joists run at right angles to the wall, the shore should abut on
the wall in such position that it points directly below the wall plate
carrying the floor joist. If the joists run parallel to the wall, the
shore should act directly on a point representing the meeting of lines
drawn down the centre of the wall and across the centre of the floor
(see fig. 50).

[Illustration: FIG. 50]

To enable the shore to fulfil this condition, the needle (of 4 in. by 3
in.) should be let through the plate 4-1/2 inches into the wall below
the point in question. To strengthen the needle cleats are nailed, and
slightly let into the plate immediately above.

The footing, or sole piece, has next to be laid. It consists of a
timber 11 in. by 3 in., and long enough to take the bottom ends of
the required number of shores. Attention should be paid to the ground
in which it is to be bedded, and if this is at all soft, additional
timbers should be laid under, and at right angles with it, to give
greater bearing.

The sole piece should not be laid at right angles to the shore, but
its face should form, with the outside line of the top shore, an angle
somewhat wider, say of 93 degrees. The advantage of this will be seen
presently.

The shore itself has now to be prepared. Its top end should be grooved
sufficiently (fig. 51) to receive the needle. This will prevent lateral
motion when under pressure.

[Illustration: FIG. 51]

The bottom end should be slightly slotted, in order to receive the end
of a crowbar (see fig. 52).

It is now placed in position, and gently tightened up by the leverage
of a crowbar acting in the slot, and using the sole piece as a fulcrum.

The advantage of the sole piece not being at right angles to the shore
can now be seen, as if it were so laid no tightening could be gained
by the leverage. This system is an improvement upon the tightening up
by wedges, as the structure is not jarred in any manner. If the frame
is to have more than one shore, they are erected in the same manner,
the bottom shore being the first put up, the others succeeding in their
turn. When in position the shores are dogged to the sole piece and a
cleat is nailed down on the outer side of the system. The bottom ends
are then bound together by hoop iron just above the ground level. To
prevent the shores sagging, struts are fixed as shown on fig. 49.

[Illustration: FIG. 52]

Besides preventing the sagging these struts serve the purpose of
keeping the shores in position. They may be fixed as nearly at right
angles to the shores as possible, or at right angles to the wall; in
any case they should reach to the wall plate at a point just below the
needle. The struts should be nailed to the shores and wall plate. If
the latter is wider than the shores, it should be cut to receive the
struts.

It sometimes occurs that the timbers are of insufficient length to
reach from the sole piece to wall plate. To overcome this difficulty,
a short timber is laid on the sole piece against and parallel to the
next middle raker, and on this short timber a rider shore stands
reaching to its position on the wall plate (see fig. 49).

When this is done the top middle raker should be stiffer to resist the
increased cross strain. Stiffness is gained by increasing the depth. A
rider shore is tightened by oak folding wedges driven between the foot
of the shore and the short timber which supports it.

Note must be taken that the outer raker is not carried too near the top
of the building, or else the upward thrust of the shores, which always
exists with raking shores, might force the bond or joints.

Fir is the best wood for shoring owing to the ease with which it can
be obtained in good length. Another advantage is its straightness of
fibre; although, as it is more easily crushed by pressure across the
grain, it does not answer so well as oak for wedges, sole pieces, &c.

In erecting flying or raking shores, notice should be taken of the
following points.

The systems should be placed from 12 to 15 feet apart if on a wall
without openings, otherwise on the piers between the openings.

In very defective walls it is an advantage to use lighter scantlings,
the systems being placed closer together. Heavy timbers handled
carelessly may precipitate the collapse which it is the intention to
avoid.

Wedge driving and tightening should be done as gently as possible. It
should be remembered that support only is to be given, and not new
thrusts set up, which may result in more harm than good.


=Underpinning.=—Underpinning is necessary to carry the upper
part of a wall, while the lower part is removed; for instance, the
insertion of a shop front, or the repairing of a foundation. It is only
kept in position until a permanent resistance to the load is effected.
Underpinning is, as a rule, unnecessary when the opening to be made
is of less width than five feet. This method of shoring is a simple
operation, but yet requires great care in its execution.

The first thing to be done is to remove from the wall all its attendant
loads. This is accomplished by strutting from the foundation floor
upwards from floor to floor until the roof is reached (see fig. 53).

Header and sole plates 9 in. by 2 in. are put in at right angles to the
joists in order to give bearing to the struts.

The portion of the wall to be taken down having been marked out, small
openings are made, slightly above the proposed removal, at from 5 to 7
feet apart, and through these, at right angles to the face of the wall
itself, steel joists or balk timbers 13 in. by 13 in., called needles,
are placed. These are supported at each end by vertical timbers 13 in.
by 13 in., called dead shores, which again rest upon sleepers.

The sleepers serve as a bed to the dead shores to which they are
dogged, and by distributing the weight over a larger area, they prevent
the dead shores sinking under the pressure. The dead shores, if well
braced, may be of smaller scantling.

Where it is impossible to arrange for the dead shores to be in one
length, the lower pieces are first fixed. They must be of uniform
length, and across their top end a transom is carried to support the
upper pieces, the bottom ends of which must stand directly over the top
ends of the lower pieces (see fig. 53).

Having placed all the timbers in position, and before the tightening up
takes place, the windows or other openings in the wall are strutted
to prevent any twisting which may take place. This is done as shown on
fig. 54, but small windows do not require the centering.

[Illustration: FIG. 53.—EXAMPLE OF UNDERPINNING]

The tightening up is caused by the driving home of oak folding
wedges placed in the joints between the needles and the dead shores.
This position is better than between the shore and sleeper, as any
inequality of driving here would have the tendency to throw the shore
out of the perpendicular. For a similar reason the wedges should be
driven in the same line as the run of the needle, as cross driving, if
unequal, would cause the needle to present an inclined surface to the
wall to be carried.

[Illustration: FIG. 54]

In carrying out these operations note should be taken of the following
points:—

1. That the dead shores should not stand over cellars or such places.
It is better to continue the needle to such a length that solid ground
is reached, and the needle can then be strutted from the dead shore.

2. That extra needles should be placed under chimney breasts, should
there be any in the wall which is to be supported. The same applies
where corbels, piers, &c. occur.

3. Sleepers and shores should be so placed that they do not interfere
with the proper construction of the new foundations or portions of the
building.

4. The inside shores should be carried freely through the floors until
a solid foundation is reached.

5. The removal of the shores after the alterations have been made is
one requiring great care. It should be remembered, that while the work
is new it cannot offer its greatest resistance to its intended load.
Time should therefore be given for the work to well set, and then
the timbers, eased gradually by the wedges being loosened, should be
finally taken out.

6. The raking shores, if used in conjunction with underpinning, should
be left to the last.




CHAPTER IV

_TIMBER_


=Classification and Structure.=—A short study of the
classification and structure of wood will be useful, as it will enable
the scaffolder to use material free from the inherent defects of its
growth.

The trees used by the scaffolder are known as the exogens or
outward-growing trees.

The cross section of an exogenous tree shows, upon examination, that
the wood can be divided into several parts. Near the centre will
be seen the pith or medulla, from which radiate what are known as
the medullary rays. These in the pine woods are often found full of
resinous matter.

Next will be noted the annual rings forming concentric circles round
the pith. They are so called because in temperate climates a new ring
is added every year by the rising and falling of the sap. As the tree
ages, the first-laid rings harden and become what is known as duramen
or heartwood. The later rings are known as alburnum or sapwood. The
distinction between the two is in most trees easily recognised, the
sapwood being lighter and softer than the heartwood, which is the
stronger and more lasting. The bark forms the outer covering of the
tree.


=Defects in the living tree.=—Shakes or splits in the interior of
the wood are the most common defects in the living tree, and are known
as _star_ or _radial_ and _cup_ or _ring shakes_.
The cause of these defects is imperfectly understood. They are rarely
found in small trees, say those of under 10 inches diameter. Stevenson,
in his book on wood, puts forward the following reason, which, up to
now, has not been refuted by any practical writer. 'In the spring, when
the sap rises, the sapwood expands under its influence and describes
a larger circle than in winter. The heartwood, being dead to this
influence, resists, and the two eventually part company, a cup or ring
shake being the result’ (see fig. 55, where the cup shake is shown in
its commonest form).

[Illustration: FIG. 55]

[Illustration: FIG. 56]

The star or radial shake is a variant of the same defect. In this case
the cohesion between the sapwood and the heartwood is greater than the
expansive forces can overcome, the result being that the heartwood
breaks up into sections as shown in fig. 56.

The star shake may have two or more arms. More than one cup shake, and
sometimes both cup and star shakes are found in a single tree. The
radial shake is probably the most common.

The branches suffer in this respect in like manner as the trunk, the
same shakes being noticeable throughout

The development of these defects is the forerunner of further decay in
the tree, giving, as they do, special facilities for the introduction
of various fungi, more especially that form of disease known as the
rot. Wet rot is found in the living tree and occurs where the timber
has become saturated by rain.

Other authorities believe that these defects are caused by severe
frost, and their idea receives support from the fact that in timber
from warmer climates this fault is less often seen. This may be so for
the reason that it would not pay traders to ship inferior timber from a
great distance.

_Loose hearts_: in the less resinous woods, as those from the
White Sea, the pith or medulla gradually dries and detaches itself,
becoming what is known as a loose heart. In the more resinous woods,
such as the Baltic and Memel, this defect is rare.

_Rind galls_ are caused by the imperfect lopping of the branches,
and show as curved swellings under the bark.

_Upsets_ are the result of a well-defined injury to the fibres
caused by crushing during the growth. This defect is most noticeable in
hard woods.

It will be of no practical use to follow the living tree further in its
steady progress towards decay, but take it when in its prime, and study
the processes which fit it for the purpose of scaffolding.


=Felling.=—The best time to fell timber, according to Tredgold,
is mid-winter, as the vegetative powers of the tree are then at rest,
the result being that the sapwood is harder and more durable; the
fermentable matters which tend to decay having been used up in the
yearly vegetation. Evelyn, in his 'Silva,’ states that: 'To make
excellent boards and planks it is the advice of some, that you should
bark your trees in a fit season, and so let them stand naked a full
year before felling.’ It is questionable if this is true of all trees,
but it is often done in the case of the oak. The consensus of opinion
is that trees should be felled in the winter, during the months of
December, January and February, or if in summer, during July. Winter
felling is probably the better, as the timber, drying more slowly,
seasons better.

The spruce from Norway and the northern fir are generally cut when
between 70 and 100 years old. When required for poles, spruce is cut
earlier, it having the advantage of being equally durable at all ages.
Ash, larch and elm are cut when between 50 and 100 years old.


=Conversion.=—By this is meant cutting the log to form balks,
planks, deals, &c. It is generally carried out before shipment. A log
is the trunk (sometimes called the stem or bole) of a tree with the
branches cut off.

A balk is a log squared. Masts are the straight trunks of trees with a
circumference of more than 24 inches. When of less circumference they
are called poles.

According to size, timbers are classed as follow:—

  Balks              12 in. by 12  inches to 18 in. by 18  inches
  Whole timber        9 in. by  9  inches to 15 in. by 15  inches
  Half timber         9 in. by  4½ inches to 18 in. by  9  inches
  Quartering          2 in. by  2  inches to  6 in. by  6  inches
  Planks             11 in. to  18 inches  by 3 in. to  6  inches
  Deals                         9  inches  by 2 in. to  4½ inches
  Battens             4½ in. to 7  inches  by ¾ in. to  3  inches

When of equal sides they are termed die square. In conversion the pith
should be avoided, as it is liable to dry rot.

When the logs are to be converted to whole timbers for use in that
size, consideration has to be given as to whether the stiffest or the
strongest balk is required. The stiffest beam is that which gives most
resistance to deflection or bending. The strongest beam is that which
resists the greatest breaking strain. The determination of either can
be made by graphic methods.

[Illustration: FIG. 57]

To cut the stiffest rectangular beam out of a log, divide the diameter
of the cross section into four parts (see fig. 57). From each outside
point, A and B, at right angles to and on different
sides of the diameter, draw a line to the outer edge of the log. The
four points thus gained on the circumferential edge, C,
D, E, F, if joined together, will give the
stiffest possible rectangular beam that can be gained from the log.

[Illustration: FIG. 58]

To cut the strongest beam:—In this case the diameter is divided into
three parts. From the two points A and B thus marked
again carry the lines to the outer edge as before. Join the four points
C, D, E, F, together, and the
outline of the strongest possible rectangular beam will result (see
fig. 58).

Boards—a term which embraces planks, deals, and battens—should be cut
out of the log in such a manner that the annual rings run parallel to
the width of the board. This method of conversion allows the knots,
which are a source of weakness, to pass directly through the board, as
A, fig. 59, and not run transversely across as other sections
(B) allow.

[Illustration: FIG. 59]


=Seasoning.=—Poles and scantlings, after conversion, are next
prepared for seasoning.

The drying yard, where the timbers are seasoned, should give protection
from the sun and high winds, although a free current of air should be
allowed. It should be remembered that rapid drying tends to warping and
twisting of the timbers.

The ground on which the timbers are stacked should be drained and kept
dry.

The method of stacking is as follows: The timbers are laid upon
supports a few inches above the ground at sufficient intervals to allow
of a free circulation of air between them, and on these others are laid
at right angles. It is usual to put long strips of wood about ¾ inch
square between each row to prevent the timbers touching, as, after a
shower, the timbers cannot dry for a long time if one is resting on the
other.

Planks, deals, &c. can be stacked by laying them in one direction
throughout, provided that the space which is left between the boards
occurs in one layer immediately over the centre of the boards beneath
(see fig. 60).

In many cases very little drying takes place before shipment, but the
same methods of stacking should be observed whenever it takes place.

Stacking poles by placing them on end is not recommended, as they may
warp from insufficient support. This point is more important when the
poles are required for ladder sides.

[Illustration: FIG. 60]

Timber may be considered to be sufficiently seasoned for rough work
when it has lost one-fifth of its weight by evaporation.

[Illustration: FIG. 61]

The poles from St. Petersburg have a narrow strip of bark removed in
four equidistant longitudinal lines throughout their entire length.
This treatment assists drying, and tends to prevent dry rot.

Weather shakes sometimes form on the outside of the wood while
seasoning (see fig. 61).

They arise owing to the sapwood contracting more when drying than the
heartwood. Unless they extend to a considerable depth they do not
affect the quality of the wood. Balk timbers, where the sapwood is
uncut, and whole timbers principally suffer in this manner.

_Water seasoning_—that is, having the timbers completely immersed
in water for a short time before drying. This is a common practice. It
is frequently carried out at the docks, where the balks may be seen
floating about on the surface of the water. This is a bad method, as
the wood is at the same time under the influence of water, sun and air.

Water seasoning may make the wood more suitable for some purposes, but
Duhamel, while admitting its merits, says: 'Where strength is required
it ought not to be put in water.’


=Description.=—Pine or northern fir (_Pinus sylvestris_) is
light and stiff, and is good for poles and scaffolding purposes, but
only the commonest of the Swedish growths are used for this purpose.
The hardest comes from the coldest districts. It has large red knots
fairly regularly placed, inclined to be soft, and starting at acute
angles. It grows chiefly in Northern Europe.

White spruce or white fir (_Abies excelsa_).—The knots are small
and irregularly placed, are dark in colour, and start at an obtuse
angle, showing an absence of clean wood. It is used principally for
scaffold poles and ladder sides. It will snap under live loads, and is
not so strong as pine. It also chiefly grows in Northern Europe.

Larch (genus _Larix_) is imported from Northern Europe and
America. It is yellow in colour, tough, and is suitable for poles,
very durable, free from knots, but warps easily.

Elm (genus _Ulmus_) grows in the British Isles. The colour varies
from the reddish-brown of the heartwood to yellowish white of the
sapwood. It bears considerable pressure across the grain, and is most
useful in balks, as it is liable to warp when in smaller sizes. Is
suitable where bolts and nails have to be used.

Birch (_Betula alba_).—Light brown in colour, hard, even grain,
which enables it to be easily and readily split in the direction of its
length. It is not considered durable. It is used chiefly for putlogs.
Is exported from Europe and America.

Ash (_Fraxinus excelsior_).—Very light brown in colour, extremely
tough, and makes excellent rungs for ladders. It is found in Europe.

Oak (genus _Quercus_), also known as the common British oak, is a
native of all parts of Europe, from Sweden to the Mediterranean. The
wood has often a reddish tinge; and the grain is fairly straight, and
splits easily. It is generally free from knots, and is most suitable
where a stiff, straight-grained wood is desirable. It also offers
considerable resistance to pressure across the grain.


=Selection.=—The importation of scaffolding timber commences in
March. In June the Russian timbers are on the market, and the arrivals
continue until October.

Poles are selected from spruce, pine, and larch trees. Balk timbers are
of elm and fir and spruce. The putlogs are from the birch.

Poles are known in two qualities—'prime’ and 'brack.’ These terms refer
to their straightness of grain, freedom from knots, regularity of
taper, which should be slight, and condition as to seasoning.

Buyers take them usually unbarked, as they rise from the stack, and
sort them afterwards for their different purposes.

As soon as possible the bark should be removed, as it holds the water
and insects, and encourages the growth of a white fungus which is the
precursor of dry rot.

The St. Petersburg poles are the most generally used for scaffolding.
They are weaker than the Christiania poles, breaking shorter under
cross strains, are whiter in colour, have a smoother bark, are
straighter in grain, and therefore make better ladder sides.

Christiania poles are more yellow in colour, and break longer under a
cross strain than other poles. They are only to be obtained early in
the year, and are soon bought up when on the market.

To test a pole remove the bark, then prise across the grain with a
penknife. If the fibres break up short and brown, the pole is decayed
and useless.

To test a pole for any local weakness lift one end, leaving the other
on the ground. Two or three sharp jerks will cause undue bending at any
spot that may be seriously defective.

Balk timbers ring, if in a sound condition, when struck with a hammer.
A fresh-cut surface should be firm, shining, and somewhat translucent.
A dull, chalky, or woolly appearance is a sign of bad timber.

Poles, unlike most converted timbers, are not branded. Those known as
_prime_ should certainly be used for scaffolding purposes. The
brack are rough and irregular in growth.

Balk timbers and smaller scantlings are, in the finest qualities,
branded, the different countries from which they are exported being
Russia, Norway and Sweden.

Russian woods are generally hammer branded, no colour being used.

Norwegian woods are marked a blue colour, and Swedish wood a red colour.

Straight-grained timber should be chosen. Twisting, which may occur
to the extent of 45°, is not so apparent in young trees. The beam is
thereby weakened as regards tension and compression.

Large knots should be avoided. They weaken the beam for tension and
cross strains, but serve good purpose when in compression.

Sap in the wood is denoted by a blue stain, and betokens inferiority
as to strength and lasting qualities. This blueness is more noticeable
when the wood is wet. It must not be confounded with dark weather
stains.


=The Decay of Timber.=—Timber exposed to the constant changes of
weather tends to decay early. It has been noticed that wood when dried
after being exposed to dampness not only lost the moisture it had
absorbed, but also part of its substance. This loss occurs in a greater
degree when these changes take place a second time. It is therefore
apparent that scaffolding timber, exposed as it is to the vicissitudes
of the weather, without any protection such as would be gained by
painting, will soon from this cause show signs of decay.

Quicklime, when wet, has also a most destructive effect upon timber;
the lime, by abstracting carbon, helping the decomposition materially.
Scaffold boards suffer most in this respect from contact with fresh
mortar, the lime in which has not had time to become mild.

From a similar cause, the ends of putlogs which are inserted in a
newly built wall, as when used in a bricklayer’s scaffold, tend to
decay rapidly.

Scaffolding poles, when used as standards, have an increased tendency
to decay at their butt ends, owing to their being imbedded in the
ground to a distance of two or three feet.

The presence of sap in improperly seasoned wood is also conducive to
early decay.


=Preservation of Timber.=—Scaffolding timber being comparatively
cheap has little attention paid to it in regard to preservation.

When out of use the poles should be stacked, and a free current of air
around each ensured, not laid carelessly on the ground, which is too
frequently the case. The same remarks apply to the care of boards.
Nails which have been driven into the timber should, after use, be
carefully drawn. When left in the wood they rust, and set up a new
source of decay.

As before noted, the butt ends of standards tend to decay early. A
fairly effective method of preventing this is to bore the butt end
upwards to a distance of about 2 feet. The bore, which should be about
1/2 inch in diameter, should then be filled with pitch and plugged. The
pitch will find its way by capillarity into the pores of the wood and
tend to keep the dampness out. Coating the outsides of the butts with
pitch is also useful, and a combination of the two would no doubt be
effectual; this is especially recommended where the standards have to
remain in one place for a long time.

Ladders and fittings that are expensive are generally painted.


=The Durability of Wood.=—In Young’s 'Annals of Agriculture’ it is
stated that experiments were made on some 1½-inch planks of 30 to 45
years’ growth. They were placed in the weather for ten years, and then
examined, with the following result:

  Larch—heart sound, sapwood decayed.
  Spruce fir—sound.
  Scotch fir—much decayed.
  Birch—quite rotten.

This experiment, while useful to show the natural resistance of the
wood to the weather, does not take into account the effect of wear and
tear.

It is almost impossible, in fact, to arrive at any data from which the
life of scaffolding timbers can be gauged; but, roughly speaking, poles
may be expected to last from six to ten years according to the care
exercised. Balk timbers, being usually cut up after a time for other
purposes, have only a short life on a scaffold, and therefore seldom
decay while in use.

[Illustration: FIG. 62]


=The Use of Scaffolding Timber.=—Poles vary up to 40 and 50
feet in length and up to 8 inches in diameter at the butt end. As
decay, which usually commences at this end, sets in, the poles can be
shortened and made into sound puncheons or splicing pieces for the
ledgers. Balks are used up to 50 or 60 feet in length; and their period
of service on a scaffold is often an interval during which they become
well seasoned and suitable for other requirements. Putlogs are about 6
feet in length and 4 inches square in cross section, tapering sharply
to 2-1/2 by 3-1/2 inches at the ends where required for insertion in
the wall. Being of square section they are not liable to roll on the
ledgers. They should be split, not sawn, in the direction of their
length. The fibres are thus uncut and absorb moisture less easily.
This procedure it is found increases their durability. When treated in
this manner they are also stronger, as the fibres, being continuous,
give greater resistance to a load, the strength not depending wholly
on the lateral adhesion, but also upon the longitudinal cohesion. When
partly decayed they can be shortened and make good struts for timbering
excavations.

The boards are usually from 7 in. to 9 in. wide and 1½ in. to 2 in.
thick. Their length averages up to 14 feet. The ends are sawn as fig.
62 and strapped with iron to prevent splitting. When decayed they are a
source of danger for which there is only one remedy—smash them up.




CHAPTER V

_CORDAGE AND KNOTS_


The fibres used for the ropes and cords for scaffolding purposes are of
jute and hemp. The strongest rope is made of the latter variety, and
the best quality is termed the Manilla.

The cords are generally tarred for preservation, but this process has a
bad effect upon the strength of the fibre, more especially if the tar
is impure. The process of tarring is as follows:—

The fibres before they are formed into strands are passed through a
bath of hot tar. Immediately afterwards, and while still hot, the
material is squeezed through nippers, by which means any surplus tar is
removed.

The ropes, as used in scaffolding, are known as shroud laid or three
strand.

A shroud-laid rope consists of three strands wound round a core, each
containing a sufficient number of fibres to make an equal thickness. A
three-strand rope is similar, but has no core.

The following gives the breaking weights of scaffold cords and falls
according to circumference[2]:—

                            Size                       Cwts.  qrs.  lbs.
  Tarred hemp scaffold   }  {2  inches in circumference  20     0     0
  Cords                  }  {2¼ inches in circumference  25     0     0
  Tarred jute scaffold   }  {2  inches in circumference  14     0     0
  Cords                  }  {2¼ inches in circumference  18     0     0
  White Manilla scaffold }  {2  inches in circumference  32     0     0
  Cord                   }  {2¼ inches in circumference  39     0     0
                            {2½ inches in circumference  44     0     0
  White Manilla rope for }  {3  inches in circumference  70     0     0
  pulleys and block ropes}  {3½ inches in circumference  98     0     0
                            {4  inches in circumference 126     0     0
                            {4½ inches in circumference 158     0     0

It should be noted that all these weights are the actual breaking
strains of the ropes tested to destruction. In practice, one sixth
of the breaking weights only should be allowed, in order to leave a
sufficient margin for safety.

The strength of a rope is the combined strength of each separate yarn.
Therefore, if the fibres are not carefully twisted together, so that
each bears an equal strain, the rope is unsafe. Care should be taken
when choosing a rope that the strands are closely, evenly and smoothly
laid.

The rope is strongest when the fibres are at an angle of 45 degrees
to the run of the rope. When at a greater angle than this, the fibres
are apt to break, and when at a less angle, the friction between the
parts—upon which the strength of a rope greatly depends—is lessened.

The durability of tarred ropes is greater than when untarred, but not
to such an extent if kept dry.

A splice weakens a rope about one eighth.

Ropes are adulterated by the admixture of rubbish fibre termed 'batch.’
To test a rope as to condition, untwist it and notice whether any short
ends break upwards. If so, or if the tarring has decayed internally,
the rope must be viewed with suspicion.

Hemp ropes, after four to six months’ wear, are often one fourth weaker
than new ones.

Scaffold cords are from 15 to 18 feet in length.

Moisture will cause a shrinkage of 6 inches in an 18-foot cord.

A good hemp rope is more reliable than an iron chain, as the latter
sometimes snaps on surgeing.

The following diagrams show the various knots used in scaffolding,
both in the erection of the scaffold and for attaching materials to a
hoist. They are shown in a loose condition as being more useful for
study by a pupil. Several knots are, however, too intricate to explain
by diagram, and in these cases an attempt has been made, with but scant
success, to instruct as to their method of creation in the notes. It
will, however, be found by the student that half an hour with an expert
scaffolder, preferably an old sailor, will afford more instruction than
hours spent in studying diagrams.

The art of knot making is governed by three principles. First, a knot
must be made quickly. Secondly, it must not jam, as this prevents it
being undone easily. Lastly, under strain, it should break before
slipping.

[Illustration: PLATE III.]

=Plate III.=—No. 1. _Overhand or thumb knot._ Prevents the
end of a rope opening out or passing through the sheaves of a block.

No. 2. _Figure of eight knot._ Used as No. 1.

No. 3. _Square or reef knot._ Will sometimes jam with small ropes.

No. 4. The knot we all make until we learn better, known as the granny,
and will both slip and jam.

No. 5. _The bend or weaver’s knot_, used for joining ropes
together or securing a rope through an eye splice.

No. 6. _Wolding stick hitch_, is serviceable only in connection
with a pole used as a lever.

No. 11. _Loop knot_, used where ends of pole are not available.

No. 12. _Boat knot._

No. 13. _Sheepshank, or dogshank_, a method of shortening a rope
without cutting it or reducing its strength.

[Illustration: PLATE IV.]

=Plate IV.=—No. 14. _Blackwall hitch_, very powerful, but
requires watching or may slip.

No. 15. _Midshipman’s hitch_, used as shown with a rounded hook.

No. 16. _Catspaw_ is an endless loop, and is used where great
power is required.

No. 17. _Capstan knot, or bowline._ After tightening it will not
slip.

No. 18. _Timber hitch_, for carrying scaffold poles. Take one turn
round the pole and standing part, and finish with jamming turns.

No. 19. _Artificer’s knot_, or half hitch and overhand.

No. 20. _Topsail halliard bend_, used as a timber hitch.

No. 21. _Bowline on a bight._ A board across the loops makes a
useful seat.

No. 22. _Racking or nippering_ is a method of temporarily joining
two ropes for lengthening purposes. The ends are laid side by side for
about 18 inches, and the marline or spunyarn is taken for about a dozen
turns round both, then by round turns over all and fastened with a reef
knot.

Nos. 23 and 24. _Round seizing._ With a slip knot at the end of
the spunyarn take a turn round the ropes to be nipped together. This
turn should be pulled tight, and continued for about a dozen turns
(No. 22); then take the end through the last turn, and take turns over
the first laid, finishing by carrying the spunyarn two or three times
between the rope and the seizing. Knot the end by jamming turns,
keeping the whole well taut (No. 24).

[Illustration: PLATE V.]

Nos. 29 and 30. _Band tie, marrying or splicing._ Commence as No.
29, and after continuing the turns until near the end of the rope, take
the rope twice between the poles and round the turns first laid, and
finish with jamming turns. Tighten with a wedge.

Nos. 31, 32 and 33. _Tying between standard and ledger._ Commence
with two half hitches as No. 31. Then twist ropes together as far as
they will go, and place ledger in position above the hitches (No. 32).
The twisted ropes are then drawn up in the front of the ledger to the
left of the standard, taken round the back of the standard, brought
again to the front and round ledger at the right of the standard, then
cross in front of the standard and round the ledger at the left of the
standard, and brought up and carried round the back of the standard.
This process is repeated until the end of the rope is nearly reached,
when it is given two or three turns round the ledger and fastened off
with jamming turns (No. 33). To tighten, drive a wedge at back of
standard.

[Illustration: PLATE VI.]

=Plate VI.=—No. 34. _Portuguese knot_ for shear legs, made by
several turns of the rope round the poles, and interlaced at the ends.

No. 35. _Running bow knot_—inferior to No. 28.

No. 36. _Bowline_—inferior to No. 17.

No. 37. _Double bend_—useful where a small rope  is bent on to a
larger. The end of the rope is given one extra turn round the bight of
the other, with the consequence of a great increase of strength.

No. 38. _Fisherman’s knot._

No. 39. _Lark’s head_, fastened to a running knot.

No. 40. Where increased strength is required a small rope can be
attached to a larger one by means of a rolling hitch. The whole
arrangement comes apart as soon as the strain is removed.

No. 41. A method of lifting scaffold poles in a vertical position by
the use of the timber hitch and half hitch. If it is required to free
the upper end while the pole is being carried, the half hitch can be
replaced by a cord tied round the pole and the lifting rope.




CHAPTER VI

_SCAFFOLDING ACCESSORIES AND THEIR USE_


=Ladders.=—A ladder consists of a pair of sides connected by a
series of oak or ash treads or rungs. The sides of long ladders are
formed by cutting lengthwise a straight fir pole into two pieces. Short
ladders are made with square sides, but they are heavier and, as the
grain seldom runs continuously throughout their length, also weaker.

The pole for the sides is selected for its straightness of fibre, for a
twisted pole cannot be sawn lengthwise without cutting across part of
the grain, which as before stated is a source of weakness.

The pole has to be bored for the rungs, and this may be done either
before or after it has been cut lengthwise. It is better to bore first,
as then the holes occur at coincident intervals on each side; the rungs
by this means are kept parallel and level.

The rungs are placed 9 inches apart, and are from 1 in. to 1-1/2-in.
in depth in the centre, decreasing to 5/8-inch diameter at the ends.
The ends of the rungs are painted with red lead before insertion, and
any projections are afterwards cut off flush with the sides. They can
be fastened at each end with wedges (see fig. 63), or pins of 1/4-inch
diameter can be cut through the sides, as fig. 64, to fix every fifth
or sixth rung.

The first method is the better, as cross boring of the sides greatly
weakens them; but as the wedges may work out, an iron rod 5/16-inch in
diameter should be placed below every eighth or ninth rung, and bolted
on the outside for extra security.

The iron rods should not be used as treads instead of the wooden rungs
as they offer an insecure foothold. The rungs are considered to be
dangerous for use when they have been reduced by wear to one half of
their original depth. The best rungs are made from old wheel-spokes, as
they are well seasoned. The sides, which may be of sufficient length
to receive 100 rungs, are 9 inches apart at the top and from 12 to 13
inches apart at the bottom, according to the length of the ladder.

[Illustration: FIG. 63]

[Illustration: FIG. 64]

Extension ladders are useful where, owing to the varying heights of the
work, different lengths of ladders are required. The two halves of the
ladder are connected in various ways, but if well made they are easily
raised and lowered. They should be used only for the very lightest
work, such as painting, cleaning down, &c.


=Trestles.=—Trestles are used chiefly by painters plasterers, and
mechanics engaged on work that is not at a great height from the ground
or floor level, and for which a platform is required. They stand from
6 to 12 feet in height, and the rungs should be sufficiently wide to
carry three boards for the working platform. They are made of yellow
deal, with mortised joints and wrought-iron hinges (fig. 65).

[Illustration: FIG. 65]


=Steps.=—Steps are built up with two sides of the required height,
about 5 inches wide and 1 inch thick; the top and bottom are sawn to a
bevel so that they stand inclined.

The steps, which are grooved into the sides and fixed with screws,
are about 6 inches wide by 1-1/2 inches thick, and increase slightly
in length as they descend. This increase adds to the stability of the
steps as the width of the base is increased. The distance between each
step is from 7 to 9 inches.

At the back of the top step two legs about 2-1/2 inches wide by
