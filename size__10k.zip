tails, the theory has
not been neglected, but has been dealt with by the use of terms well
understood in the building trade. The various formulæ given have been
simplified as far as possible, and it is hoped that in these days of
technical education they will not be beyond the scope of the reader.

The illustrations have generally been drawn to scale, but for the sake
of clearness, details are given to a larger scale where necessary.

The practice of allowing workmen to erect scaffolds without the aid
of expert supervision, as is generally the case, is to be strongly
deprecated. The architect, builder, or clerk of works, should in all
cases be responsible for their erection—the risk of defective or unsafe
work being thereby minimised, and an economy often effected in both
labour and material.

The author desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr. G.
Thatcher, of H.M. Office of Works and Hampton Court Palace, for
valuable information contributed by him, and to Mr. J. Clark, of
the Factory Department of the Home Office, for his very careful
reading of the proofs; while his best thanks are due to the following
manufacturers:—Mr. C. Batchelor, Messrs. Bullivant & Co., Ltd., Messrs.
Butters Bros., Mr. J. Fishburn, Messrs. Frost & Co., and Mr. E. Palmer,
who have furnished him with particulars of their various specialities.

NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION


Recent alterations in and additions to the legal enactments affecting
scaffolding and the persons employed in its erection have rendered
necessary a second edition of this work. The author has accordingly
revised the information relating to the law of the subject, and has
embodied the important series of suggestions for the guidance of those
engaged in building operations, published in the Annual Report of the
Chief Inspector of Factories, which, if followed out, will undoubtedly
be the means of reducing the number of fatal and other accidents
occurring at such works.
